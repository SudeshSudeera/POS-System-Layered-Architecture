# POS-System-Layered-Architecture
This application allows a supermarket system to manage customers, products, and orders. Every customer has a loyalty card and can save details related to the card. They were then grouped according to the quantity ordered and given discounts according to group type. When products are entered into the system, a QR code is generated for each product with QTY, discount, and price. When placing an order, the product details should pop up in the QR code window. QTY is kept with products and the total price after order entry. Each user must create an account and log into the system.<br><br>
